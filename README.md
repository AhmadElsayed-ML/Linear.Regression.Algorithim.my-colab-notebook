# Titanic Survival Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the probability of a passenger surviving the Titanic disaster. Using the **Linear Regression** algorithm, I trained the model on the famous Titanic dataset, which includes details about passengers such as age, class, and gender.

## Features

- Preprocessing Titanic dataset for modeling.
- Training a linear regression model for survival prediction.
- Insights and evaluation of the model's performance.
